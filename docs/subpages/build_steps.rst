Steps to get logging set up:
****************************

If you plan on using Splunk/Jupyter Notebooks/OSQuery/Kolide - install the required scripts on the Ubuntu box first before setting up logging on endpoints.


On Ubuntu box:
###############

1. On the Ubuntu machine download the Marvel-Lab repository.
2. Go into ``Marvel-Lab\Logging\splunk`` and run ``splunk_logging.sh``.

**Note**: Only Ubuntu 18 is supported for this script.

On Workstation and DC:
######################

1. Download the Marvel-Lab repository in the ``C:\`` directory. (If you
   downloaded the .zip of the repo, move the child folder to the
   C: directory and rename to ``Marvel-Lab``).
2. Go into ``Marvel-Lab\Logging`` and run ``Logging.ps1``.

**Note:** The Sysmon configuration is up to date with version - 11.0.
FileDelete Events will only be logged within the
``\Downloads`` folder of each user. Deletions are saved within
the ``C:\ArchivedFiles`` folder.
